# PRODIGY_CS_02

## 📌 Task Overview
This project is part of my **Cyber Security Internship** with **Prodigy InfoTech**.

**Task 02:** Develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation.  
The program can encrypt and decrypt images by modifying each pixel’s RGB values based on a secret key.

---

## 🛠 Features
- **Encrypt** an image by altering its pixel values.
- **Decrypt** the image back to its original state.
- Simple and beginner-friendly Python implementation.
- Works with any image format supported by the Pillow library.

---

## 📂 How It Works
1. **Encryption** → Adds a key value to each pixel's Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) values.
2. **Decryption** → Subtracts the key value to restore the original image.

## 🚀 Usage
### 1️⃣ Install dependencies
```bash
pip install pillow
